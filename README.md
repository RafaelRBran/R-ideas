# R-ideas
My simple and (not necessarily) organized ideas for functions in R.

Introduction
------------
This repository is simply a place for organize my ideas related to R scripting.

Here you will find a lot of functions (implemented using only default R tools), that I found useful at some point.
I hope this can be useful for you too!

Documentation
-------------
I will try my best to document such functions in order to make it clear which concepts are been used.
I will also try to report the sources used if there are any.

However, I want to warn you that (i) english is not my first language and (ii) I will not necessarily post "organised" code at the first commit.
So, if there is something hard to understand or "mispelled", please be patient. I will probably fix it at a future commit.

Contributing 
------------
Although this repo is an extension of my work and my way of study R, all help is welcome (from minor fixes in the documentation to completely new functions).

As a general rule, the functions should be both simple and as general as possible. Load packages is not allowed, but you can use other functions defined in this project.

Please try to be concise and report all sources used (even if it's a question in stackoverflow).
